# Local Discord Bot

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a Discord bot that allows users to subscribe and have their messages' characters counted by the bot. The bot will reply with a dictionary containing a mapping of each character in the message to a count of the number of times that character appeared in the message.

## Setup and Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
3. Set the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable with your bot's token.
4. Run the `set_up_and_run_bot.sh` script to set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and start the bot.
